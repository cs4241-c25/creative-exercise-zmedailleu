## Polygon Demonstration
- your hosting link e.g. http://creative-exercise-githubname.glitch.me
- I decided to use work with SVGs to draw different polygons to the screen.
- Examples used to write my code:
- https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_intro.asp
- https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_scripting.asp
- https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_animation.asp
- The changes I made were the sizes of the polygons used, the colors used, the type of shape for the polygons created using the <polygon> tag, and differences in behavior for the button and animation.
